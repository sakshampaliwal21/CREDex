       flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
       center: Items align at the center of the container.
       space-between:Items are spread out ,first item at the start, last item at the end
       space-around: Equal space around each item, but that means outer edges have half the space compared to the space between items.
       space-evenly:Spaces items with equal gaps between and outside items
       For example, justify-content: flex-end; will move the frog to the right.
       row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
       row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
       column: Items are placed top to bottom.
       column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.*/
